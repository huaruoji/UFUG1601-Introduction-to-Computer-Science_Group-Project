# UFUG1601 Introduction to Computer Science - Group Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the group project for the course UFUG1601 Introduction to Computer Science at HKUST(GZ).

We chose project #7: Movie Popularity and Rating Trends Analysis.

## Project Proposal: Movie Popularity and Rating Trends Analysis

### Objective
Analyze movie rating data to understand trends in movie popularity and user ratings over time.

### Data Source
[TMDB Top Rated 9000 Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaditya1gautam/tmdb-top-rated-9000-movies-dataset)

### Suggested Tasks
1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
2. **Movie Rating Analysis**: Analyze the average ratings (`vote_average`) and identify the highest and lowest rated movies.
3. **Popularity Analysis**: Study the relationship between movie popularity (`popularity`) and ratings, as well as the number of votes (`vote_count`).
4. **Genre Analysis**: Use genre data (`genre_ids`) to analyze the ratings and popularity of different movie genres.
5. **Temporal Analysis**: Explore trends in movie ratings and popularity across different release years.
6. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution, ratings, and popularity of movies using charts and graphs.
7. **Recommendation System Basics**: Attempt to recommend movies to users using a simple algorithm.

### Requirements
- Use Python for data processing and analysis.
- Employ the Pandas library for data manipulation.
- Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data visualization.
- Document the analysis process and results in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Submit a report that includes code, analysis results, and visualizations.

### Outcomes
- Students will learn to clean and analyze data using Python.
- Students will understand the characteristics of movie data and how to conduct popularity and rating analyses.
- Students will learn to use data visualization tools to present analysis results.
- Students will gain basic knowledge of recommendation systems and how to build simple recommendation algorithms.
